ðŸ“Š Blinkit Sales Dashboard: Turning Data into Decisions

Just wrapped up a dynamic Power BI dashboard for Blinkit, highlighting key sales insights across outlet types, item categories, and fat content preferences. Here's how I broke it down:

ðŸ”¹ Cards & Slicer Panel Quick-glance metrics like Total Sales ($1.2M), Avg Rating (3.9), and Item Count (8523), with filters for Outlet Size, Location Type, and Item Typeâ€”making the dashboard fully interactive.

ðŸ¥§ Pie Charts

Fat Content: Regular items dominate with $776K in sales.

Outlet Size: Small outlets lead with $507K, followed by High and Medium.

ðŸ“Š Clustered Bar Chart Fat content across tiers shows Tier 3 outlets pushing the most Low Fat salesâ€”valuable for regional targeting.

ðŸ”» Funnel Chart Top-selling categories: Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods at $200K each. A clear drop-off in niche categories like Seafood and Breakfast Foods.

ðŸ“‹ Matrix View Outlet Type Description reveals Supermarket Type 1 as the top performer with $787K in sales and 5577 items soldâ€”ideal for benchmarking outlet strategies.

ðŸŽ¯ Why it matters: This dashboard isnâ€™t just about numbersâ€”itâ€™s about enabling smarter decisions for inventory, marketing, and outlet expansion.
